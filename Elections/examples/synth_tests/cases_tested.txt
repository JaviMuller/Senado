Test case explanation:
  3        - 1 winner in 1st round, elected by majority
  4.1      - More than 2 winners in 1st round (1st round tiebreaker)
  4.2.a.i  - 1 winner in @1st round, sum of two first >50%, tie for second place
  4.2.a.ii - 1 winner in @1st round, sum of two first >50%, no tie for second place
  4.2.b    - 1 winner in @1st round, sum of two first <= 50%
  4.3.c    - 2 winners in @1st round, sum of two first >50%
  4.3.d    - 2 winners in @1st round, sum of two first <=50%, sum of three first >50%
  4.3.e    - 2 winners in @1st round, sum of two first <=50%, sum of three first <=50%
  5.5      - Presidential tie breaker (it will use all tiebreaker criteria)
  spec1    - Custom made criteria. Diminishing consequent preferential tiebreakers
  spec2    - Custom made criteria. 1st round without votes
  spec3    - Custom made criteria. 4.3.e + absolute tie breaker (tie in special second round)


@1st round = 1st round + tiebreakers

Notes: 
   - On the synthetic tests, the presidential choice is always the first one.
   - The rest of the rounds of synth2 have not been checked because they are not necessary
   to check all the cases
